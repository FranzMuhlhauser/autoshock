- Background color: Dark gradients of premium black (#0A0A0A) and premium dark (#1A1A1A) for an elegant and premium feel.
- Accent color: Blue (#3b82f6) for secondary buttons like Waze, providing visual distinction.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for titles (h1, h2, h3) to provide a modern and bold character.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, paragraphs, descriptions, and interface elements to ensure excellent legibility.
- Use a consistent style for icons throughout the site, ensuring they are related to the content and enhance the user experience. Consider a set of icons in a line style, filled style, or duotone style that aligns with the overall aesthetic of the page.
- Subtle fade-in animations on scroll to reveal sections. Hover effects on buttons (color change), menu links (animated underline), and images (slight zoom).
